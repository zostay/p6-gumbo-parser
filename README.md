# p6-gumbo-parser

This is an attempt at creating a Perl6 library for using the gumbo-parser for
parsing HTML5. At this point, it is mostly O(fun) and incomplete. Part of the
reason for this incompleteness is the immaturity of the native library tools
available to Perl6 programs running on MoarVM.

Anyway, it's a start.
